# what is this?

currently I'm prototyping a personal website using framer to get the exact look of my website that I want, after which I can fully handcode the website to fix any optimization issues or such

# is this coding?

yes, specific elements within prototyping do require me to code BUT also for now I'm using framer as just a design tool and will be coding out the website when I am done with the design

# why aren't there many changes in the commits?

it is prototyping, most of the changes will be within one big code block so 50 different changes could look like 1 addition!

# questions or suggestions?

hit my socials (found on the website)
